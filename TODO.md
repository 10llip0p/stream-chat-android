Cleanup

- Rename ChatRepo (ChatController perhaps)
- Rename ChannelRepo & QueryChannelsRepo & ThreadRepo (It's actually between the repo and the viewmodel. A bit like a use case, but also different)
- Event handling should run blocking during tests
- Interfaces for testability
- Evaluate use cases based API
- Update LLC
- User updates
