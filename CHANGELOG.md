## September 28, 2019 - 2.0.1

- Fix channel list ordering when a channel is added directly from Android
- Better Proguard support

## September 26, 2019 - 2.0.0

- Simplify random access to channels
- Channel query and watch methods now work the same as they do on all other SDKs

### Breaking changes:

- `channel.query` does not watch the channel anymore, to retrieve channel state and watch use `channel.watch`
- `client.getChannelByCID` is now private, use one of the `client.channel` methods to get the same (no null checks needed)
