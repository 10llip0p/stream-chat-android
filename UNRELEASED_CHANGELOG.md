## stream-chat-android-client
### 🐞 Fixed

### ⬆️ Improved

### ✅ Added
- `PushMessage` class created to store Push Notification data
- `PushDeviceGenerator` interface to obtain the Push Token and create the `Device`

### ⚠️ Changed
- `Device` class has an extra attribute with the `PushProvider` used on this device
- `RemoteMessage` from Firebase is not used anymore inside of our SDK, now it needs to be used with `PushMessage` class
- `NotificationConfig` has a new list of `PushDeviceGenerator` instance to be used for generating the Push Notification Token. If you were using `Firebase` as your Push Notification Provider, you need to add `FirebasePushDeviceGenerator` to your `NotificationConfig` object to continue working as before

### ❌ Removed
- Remove `ChatClient.isValidRemoteMessage()` method. It needs to be handled outside
- Remove `ChatClient.handleRemoteMessage(RemoteMessage)`. Now it needs to be used `ChatClient.handlePushMessage(PushMessage)`
